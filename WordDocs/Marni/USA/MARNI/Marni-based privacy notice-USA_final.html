                            <h2>11. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS & HOW WE RESPOND TO “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the right to request and receive certain information about a company’s disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties for their own direct marketing use, and your choices with respect to such disclosures. Because we do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their own direct marketing use unless you are first given the opportunity to opt in or out, we are exempt from this requirement. If you still wish to learn more about our compliance with this requirement, please contact us at the address listed in paragraph 1.</p>

                            <p>As of January 1, 2020, you may be entitled to the below rights:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>the right to know. </strong>You may request information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you over the last 12 months, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the sale or disclosure for business purposes of your Personal Data to third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom this information was shared. You may also request a copy of the Personal Data we have collected, and upon request, we will provide this information to you in electronic form; </li>
                                <li><strong>the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data to third parties. </strong>We do not sell your Personal Data at this time, and we do not sell the Personal Data of children under 16 years old;    </li>

Whenever feasible for verification, we will match the identifying information provided by you to the Personal Data already maintained by us. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request additional information. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. Such authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State and must have permission to submit requests on your behalf. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>

                            <h2>12. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>

                            <p> The “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.</p>

                            <h2>13. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>

                            <p>We may use advertisers, third-party ad platform, tracking technologies and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Site and to improve the performance of our advertising across the Internet. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather Personal Data about your visit to our Site or other websites (such as through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1  here and DAA website here https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&#38;lang=EN.</p>

We may use third-party products and services to secure or store your information. We encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our Site.

                            <p>Additionally, please do not forget that it is essential for the safety of your data that your device is equipped with tools such as constant antivirus updates and that your internet provider provides a connection ensuring a secure data transmission through firewalls, spam filters, and similar measures.</p>

                            <h2>16. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>

                            <h2>17. DISPUTES, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CHOICE OF LAW</h2>

                            <p>By using the Site, you and we agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Site, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Privacy Statement or any part of it (“Dispute”), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.</p>

                            <p>Notice shall be sent:</p>

                            <p>(1) to us at the address(es) listed above, towards the beginning of this Privacy Statement; and (2) to you at: the contact information on file with us.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Privacy Statement, including any claim that all or any part of this Privacy Statement is void or voidable. This Privacy Statement has been made in, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles. The parties acknowledge that this Privacy Statement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.

Your information may be shared following completion of such transaction and/or during the assessment process pending transfer. If transferred in such a case, your information would remain subject to this Privacy Statement or a privacy policy that, at a minimum, protects your privacy to an equal degree as this Privacy Statement.</p>
