# MsWordToHtml
These scripts turn MsWord Documents into HTML using VBA Macros in MsWord.
The main utility of this repository is described above, but in particular this was made for my work. I have a folder with bunch of ms word documents that I need to convert in html. As this process would have taken so much time to do, I made this repositry that takes all the docs one by one, turn them into html and then another script takes all the html files and bind them together to to make a unique html file!
